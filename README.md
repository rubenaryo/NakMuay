# Nak Muay
A Kickboxing/Muay Thai themed combat sim developed with Unreal Engine 5.2

## Details
This is a UE5 project I built to experiment with their animation pipeline. I built a custom combo system that buffers user input to string together Animation Montages, which themselves have Anim Notifies to denote hitbox activity, movement speed overrides, and target snapping.

## Features
- Combo System built with custom artist-editable data assets for combo definitions
- Dynamic hit reactions that intelligently use the penetration vector from a hitbox collision to map to the correct animation automatically
- Lock-On System and Blendspace movement
- Each Animation Montage can contain custom Notifies which denote character snapping, movement speed overrides, and hitbox activation windows
